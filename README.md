# RESTful-webservice
Basic program that converts class instance to JSON , we make use of GET method of HTTP protocol.

In order to execute you need STS application installed in your computer. Then you should create spring boot starter project by some name as in my example it is demoProject..... in that we need to create 3 classes in total. You can see the code present in src/main and it is self explanatory. You dont need the tomcat server instead you should run it as Spring app and then browse for http://localhost/8081/st
as i used 8081 port and st is list object.
